### Install

Before you can use the box you need to have Virtualbox and Vagrant installed on your system.

##### Download Vagrant [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

1. Make a new directory:

2. In the new directory run this command:
   `vagrant init johnxeast/drybox`. This will create a file called '**Vagrantfile**' which is your vagrant config file. You can edit it as you wish.

3. You can validate the '**Vagrantfile**' with `vagrant validate`. If everything's good it should say "**Vagrantfile validated successfully.**"
